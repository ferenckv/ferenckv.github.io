After several attempts, I decided to build my personal web page / blog. From my time in [Acklen Avenue](https://acklenavenue.com/){:target="_blank"} I remember using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll){:target="_blank"}  to publish a simple but powerful static website with blog capabilities, so I put my hands to work. I created the [repo](https://github.com/ferenckv/ferenckv.github.io){:target="_blank"} and published a "Hello world":

![Hello World](/assets/img/posts/2023-12-08-personal-web-page/hello-world.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Cool, yeah? Only that *it was [two years ago](https://github.com/ferenckv/ferenckv.github.io/commit/bfea5a0061a43cc2c285e3488c25c6fdc38d3563){:target="_blank"}*.

So this week I kind of remembered about that and I tried to start over. I stuck with GitHub Pages and Jekyll because it was a very cool and easy to implement option. And after a few google searches looking for a good template I found Sujay Kundu's [devlopr](https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll/){:target="_blank"} template ([buy he a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sujaykundu){:target="_blank"} please!).

It was really easy to implement. Here it is, my very first blog post (not AI generated, I promise!). I hope I can keep it going and write a few posts here and there and also improve the look and feel from time to time.
